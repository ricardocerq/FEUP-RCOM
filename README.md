Project 1 - A simple communications protocol was developed using a Stop-And-Wait ARQ and a bitwise parity checksum for ensuring data integrity, with the aim of providing a reliable communication channel between two computers connected via serial port.

Then, the application used this protocol to transfer a file between the computers. The operation is resilient to disconnections and noise in the communication.
